Hello y'all,
<br>
<br>
You have reached the website of me, Athula Pudhiyidath. I'm currently a Ph.D. student studying the cognitive neuroscience of learning and memory in the Preston Lab <a href="https://clm.utexas.edu/preston/">Preston Lab</a> at the University of Texas at Austin. 
<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to use this website to showcase some of my current research. But for now, here is a picture I took of of two koi fish in a serene moss garden in Kyoto, Japan.
